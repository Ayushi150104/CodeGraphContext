## Dependencies

- `neo4j>=5.15.0`
- `watchdog>=3.0.0`
- `requests>=2.31.0`
- `stdlibs>=2023.11.18`
- `typer[all]>=0.9.0`
- `rich>=13.7.0`
- `inquirerpy>=0.3.4`
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`
- `tree-sitter==0.20.4`
- `tree-sitter-languages==1.10.2`

## Getting Started

1.  **Install:** `pip install codegraphcontext`
2.  **Configure Your Environment:**
    Run the interactive setup wizard to connect to your database and configure your IDE:
    ```bash
    cgc setup
    ```
    The wizard helps you with:
    -   **Database Connection:**
        -   **Docker (Recommended):** Automatically sets up a local Neo4j instance.
        -   **Linux Binary:** Installs Neo4j directly on Debian-based systems.
        -   **Hosted:** Connects to a remote Neo4j database like AuraDB.
    -   **IDE Integration:**
        -   Automatically configures tools like VS Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and more.
        -   Generates the necessary `mcp.json` and `.env` files for you.

3.  **Start:** `cgc start`

## MCP Client Configuration

The `cgc setup` command attempts to automatically configure your IDE/CLI. If you choose not to use the automatic setup, or if your tool is not supported, you can configure it manually.

Add the following server configuration to your client's settings file (e.g., VS Code's `settings.json` or `.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CodeGraphContext": {
      "command": "cgc",
      "args": [
        "start"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "YOUR_NEO4J_URI",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "YOUR_NEO4J_USERNAME",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD"
      },
      "tools": {
        "alwaysAllow": [
          "add_code_to_graph",
          "add_package_to_graph",
          "check_job_status",
          "list_jobs",
          "find_code",
          "analyze_code_relationships",
          "watch_directory",
          "find_dead_code",
          "execute_cypher_query",
          "calculate_cyclomatic_complexity",
          "find_most_complex_functions",
          "list_indexed_repositories",
          "delete_repository",
          "visualize_graph_query",
          "list_watched_paths",
          "unwatch_directory"
        ],
        "disabled": false
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Natural Language Interaction Examples

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through your AI assistant using plain English. Here are some examples of what you can say:

### Indexing and Watching Files

-   **To index a new project:**
    -   "Please index the code in the `/path/to/my-project` directory."
    OR
    -   "Add the project at `~/dev/my-other-project` to the code graph."


-   **To start watching a directory for live changes:**
    -   "Watch the `/path/to/my-active-project` directory for changes."
    OR
    -   "Keep the code graph updated for the project I'm working on at `~/dev/main-app`."

    When you ask to watch a directory, the system performs two actions at once:
    1.  It kicks off a full scan to index all the code in that directory. This process runs in the background, and you'll receive a `job_id` to track its progress.
    2.  It begins watching the directory for any file changes to keep the graph updated in real-time.

    This means you can start by simply telling the system to watch a directory, and it will handle both the initial indexing and the continuous updates automatically.

### Querying and Understanding Code

-   **Finding where code is defined:**
    -   "Where is the `process_payment` function?"
    -   "Find the `User` class for me."
    -   "Show me any code related to 'database connection'."

-   **Analyzing relationships and impact:**
    -   "What other functions call the `get_user_by_id` function?"
    -   "If I change the `calculate_tax` function, what other parts of the code will be affected?"
    -   "Show me the inheritance hierarchy for the `BaseController` class."
    -   "What methods does the `Order` class have?"

-   **Exploring dependencies:**
    -   "Which files import the `requests` library?"
    -   "Find all implementations of the `render` method."

-   **Advanced Call Chain and Dependency Tracking (Spanning Hundreds of Files):**
    The CodeGraphContext excels at tracing complex execution flows and dependencies across vast codebases. Leveraging the power of graph databases, it can identify direct and indirect callers and callees, even when a function is called through multiple layers of abstraction or across numerous files. This is invaluable for:
    -   **Impact Analysis:** Understand the full ripple effect of a change to a core function.
    -   **Debugging:** Trace the path of execution from an entry point to a specific bug.
    -   **Code Comprehension:** Grasp how different parts of a large system interact.

    -   "Show me the full call chain from the `main` function to `process_data`."
    -   "Find all functions that directly or indirectly call `validate_input`."
    -   "What are all the functions that `initialize_system` eventually calls?"
    -   "Trace the dependencies of the `DatabaseManager` module."

-   **Code Quality and Maintenance:**
    -   "Is there any dead or unused code in this project?"
    -   "Calculate the cyclomatic complexity of the `process_data` function in `src/utils.py`."
    -   "Find the 5 most complex functions in the codebase."

-   **Repository Management:**
    -   "List all currently indexed repositories."
    -   "Delete the indexed repository at `/path/to/old-project`."
